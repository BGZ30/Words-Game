# Words-Game
This is the source code for words Game, it was an assignment for a course I did on edx, and it passed all the test cases. This code was written in python 2.7.

In this game the computer chooses a random set of alphabet, and the player should try to build words as long as possible out of that set of alphabet and it would be better to build words as much as possible too. Each word has a weight according to its length and letters. The final score is the sum of weights of all the words the player had built.

The player also can play versus the computer, but the computer always gets the highest possible score.

Course name:  6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python.
